  I welcome the opportunities to help non-profits when i have time, through consulting. I have working with DSMHack for the past 2 years. DSMHack (https://dsmHack.org) - a not-for-profit organization working to elevate and strengthen the community by building software, learning from each other and giving back.  I have provided technical assistance for the teams and Staff, basically helped out.
  I am also open to small commercial consulting as per project (or hourly basis).
