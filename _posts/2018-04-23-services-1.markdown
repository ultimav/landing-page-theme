  I work with a very small team of individuals tasked with helping bring our company into a new digital era, on premise and in the “cloud”. We are the Oregon Trail pioneers, if you will, but without the chance of dysentery. We use a maverick spirit for innovation. We pivot on dimes, learning as we go, spreading the tribe knowledge. #elevatorpitch #workinprogress #a2forever
  In my previous team I helped our company's approximately 1500 developers do their jobs better. We did this by providing the infrastructure and tooling they need to support development. Tools include CI/CD pipelines, artifact and dependency management, source code management. I managed the full stack on more that 40 servers application to commandline. Upgrades, scripting, backups, certificates, as well as custom plugins to integrate with existing company systems.
